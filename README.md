# CS2SnapTap Bypass 
This is just a personal SnapTap Project for CS2 I made in python to get past the recent VAC 3.0 SnapTap &amp; SOCD Detections with an included 64 tick based Bhop Script. I dont like to use AutoHotKey/AHK I feel like they will ban this someday like every other anti-cheat, I'll probably work on a simple kernel version of this.
# How it works
Random Delay.

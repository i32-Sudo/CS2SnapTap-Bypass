# CS2SnapTap Bypass 
This is just a personal SnapTap Project for CS2 I made in python to get past the recent VAC 3.0 SnapTap &amp; SOCD Detections with an included 64 tick based Bhop Script. I dont like to use AutoHotKey/AHK I feel like they will ban this someday like every other anti-cheat, I'll probably work on a simple kernel version of this.
# Features
- SnapTapping with Randomization
- 64Tick Based Bhop Script
- CounterStrafing with Randomization & Hotkey
# Undetected?
As of 9.2.2024 and probably for a long time yes, it is undetected. ClientSide VAC does not scan or iterate keyboard events or mouse events so this is completely fine to use. If you dont want the Python Interpreter to get enumerated compile it and use VMP or another packer/virtualizer.
# Bhop Config
In your CSGO Game CFG Directory add the bhop.cfg file in it, next execute both commands in binds.txt in the console, it should execute bhop.cfg everytime you jump and this will let you hit 70% of your Bhops

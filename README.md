# CS2 No Modify Movement Cheat
This is a simple Python based project to create a good and reliable movement (macro) based CS2 Cheat that can BHOP, Counter-Strafe and SnapTap without getting detected by the new VAC 3.0 Input Automation
# Features
- SnapTapping with Randomization
- 64Tick Based Bhop Script & DeSubtick Config
- CounterStrafing with Randomization & Hotkey
# Undetected?
As of 9.2.2024 and probably for a long time yes, it is undetected. ClientSide VAC does not scan or iterate keyboard events or mouse events so this is completely fine to use. If you dont want the Python Interpreter to get enumerated compile it and use VMP or another packer/virtualizer.
# Bhop Config
In your CSGO Game CFG Directory `game/csgo/cfg` add the bhop.cfg file in it, next execute both commands in binds.txt in the console, it should execute bhop.cfg everytime you jump and this will let you hit 70% of your Bhops
